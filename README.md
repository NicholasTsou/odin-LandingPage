Making an entire website from scratch.<br>
Using my knowledge of HTML/CSS to make a basic website homepage.<br>

AFTERTHOUGHTS: <br>

This was a simple project but it was a fun one. It brought me back to when me and <br>
my friends we're learning HTML/CSS in school. Now it feels so much simpler than it <br>
did back then. You just have to remember display: flex EVERYTHING.
